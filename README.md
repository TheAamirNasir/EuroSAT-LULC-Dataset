EuroSAT: A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Land Use and Land Cover Classification

EuroSAT is a land use and land cover classification dataset. The dataset is based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery covering 13 spectral bands and consists of 10 LULC classes with a total of 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images. The dataset is associated with the publications "Introducing EuroSAT: A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Land Use and Land Cover Classification" and "EuroSAT: A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Land Use and Land Cover Classification".

EuroSAT_RGB contains the RGB version of the dataset, which includes the optical R, G and B frequency bands encoded as JPEG images.

This dataset contains 27,000 RGB Satellite Images across 10 classes:

Annual Crop
Forest
Herbaceous Vegetation
Highway
